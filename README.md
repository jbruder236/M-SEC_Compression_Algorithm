# M-SEC_Compression_Algorithm
A Multi-Stage Encoding/Compression Algorithm

The Multi-Stage Encoding Compression (M-SEC) algorithm compresses binary and plain text files using the Burrows-Wheeler transform, move-to-front coding, and Huffman coding.
The M-SEC code is also able to invert these transforms and decompress any files that have been compressed.
M-SEC is a lossless compression algorithm.

This project was coded/implemented for the class: CSE 3500 Algorithms at UConn.
